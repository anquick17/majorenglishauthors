    <p class=writing> I met a Bishop the other day, and he decided to try and put me down. He said that my veins must soon be dry and my breasts are flat and fallen now. I am not sure why a religious man like that is looking at my breasts, but oh well. I know I am a prostitute, but isn’t a holy man supposed to suppress their urges like that? With his eyes still searching for more insults to spit in my face, I formulated an amazing comeback. My mantra has always been: “Fair and foul are near of kin, and fair needs foul,” so that’s the first thing I spit at him. Fair and foul go hand in hand, just like good and bad. You cannot have fair without foul, and you cannot have foul without fair, they are like cousins. It does not matter if someone sees me as more of a foul person, because when foul is present, “fair” is inside me somewhere. I decided to remind the Bishop—who was already shell-shocked at this point—that everyone, regardless of whether they are labeled “fair” or “foul” by society, will die and everyone can partake in the taboo act of sex. Good and bad people alike can have sex and will die at some point. If you are a good person, it’s not like you get excused from death.

    After preaching to him, I decided to add some funny innuendos to freak him out. I decided to personify love and say that it lives in the “place of excrement.” It means love lives in your butt. That literally shows that foul has fair in it. And if I worked hard enough that could have been a sex joke as well but I didn’t want to overdo it. I thought he might get a kick out of that one but he just looked at me with a blank face. But I wasn’t done with my little innuendos. I said that nothing can be sole or whole that has not been rent… HA! Get it? Nothing can be in your soul or your (butt)hole if it has not been used up and/or broken. After I dropped that bomb he looked me in the eyes one more time and walked away… I hope he can look past the innuendos and see that I actually made a point there. Everyone has been broken at a point in their life, whether that be a bone or their heart. So no one can be perfect without being broken at least once. For me, it has been more than once, and I don’t see myself as perfect, but I am more perfect who has had a flawless life… Maybe I messed up adding innuendos to my amazing speech, but I thought it was worth it. Being a prostitute, I have seen my fair share of foul things. Yet somehow, I have tried to make the best out of those awful times. So somehow, “fair” always comes to the surface when I am having a terrible moment. If you learned nothing from this blog post, please walk away with this piece of information: there is no fair without foul; so do not ignore the foul, cherish it.
