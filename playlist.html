<p class=writing> Here are a couple of songs that I enjoy. My songs are usually a tell tale sign of how I feel at the moment, so this will be updated whenever I remember to do it. Enjoy the songs and my thoughts on them. </p>

        <p class="title">by Amy Winehouse</p>
        <p>Amy Winehouse has been one of my favorite artists. "Back to Black" has been my anthem for a while. With all of the men in my life trying to belittle me (like the Bishop...), this song reminds me that many men pick me as their second choice. But how do I change? I can’t change. Society has pushed me down, I will never socially be seen as the first choice… Amy Winehouse reminds me that I am not alone. She was the second choice once too, and so are many other women. But we all move on. It's better to see the good in life.

        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUNqsfFUwhY"> Here Comes the Sun </a></h2>
        <p class="title">by The Beatles</p>
        <p>I have gone through a lot but I still feel thankful for so many things. There is no fair without foul; so do not ignore the foul, cherish it. This song helps me remember that there are great things in life, but there  has to be bad to make those things so good. The sun is always something I can look at and remember that there is at least one thing in my life that is good. If the sun can get up every day, so can I.

        <p class="title">by The Police</p>
        <p>I’ll be transparent with everyone… I am a prostitute. I can no longer be ashamed of it. But this song is a great reminder that many people are going through the same thing, and The Police even made a song about it. The beginning of the song starts with the lead singer saying that this prostitute they are speaking to doesn’t have to “put on the red light” and that she doesn't "have to [sell] her body tonight.” This song is a reminder to me that I am not the only person who is going through the hardships of being a prostitute. At least the person singing this song is warning this person about not becoming a prostitute. Although I am not ashamed of who I am, I also would not tell people to lead the same life I am.

        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqAJLh9wuZ0"> The Man </a></h2>
        <p class="title">by Taylor Swift</p>
        <p>This is a direct reference to my experience with the Bishop. That man… was awful. He thought that he could tear me down saying that my “breasts are flat and fallen now,” my “veins must soon be dry,” and that I live in “some foul sty.” He wasn’t wrong, but does it matter? Neither death nor sex denies a moral or immoral person, regardless we will all die and we can all have sex even if we are the worst person or the best person in the world. So why does it matter? This song poses a great questions, how easy would it be in this world as a man? I could do whatever I wanted, I could make more money. I wouldn’t be in this situation if I was a man.

        <p class="title">by Lorde</p>
        <p>I don’t have money. I have to sell my body for money, yet I am still kicking and have a love for life. This song is an anthem for people who do not have much money. Like Lorde, I’ve “never seen a diamond in the flesh,” I haven’t really seen many things worth a lot of money in the flesh… It feels good to admit that. Many people like to shoot me down because I am poor and I do not have nicer things but they are the negative ones. I prevail and can be happy at where I am in life.
